# Automate certification process by utilizing DCI to interact with the catalog backend
This repository demonstrates how to automate the certification of container projects for CNFs. This includes recertifying container images, as well as fully automating the end-to-end process of creating, updating, attaching, and publishing container projects for multiple images at once.

## Summary: 
The objective of this repository is to demonstrate how to improve the container certification process by leveraging the new features of DCI. The process involves creating container projects, updating mandatory parameters, testing and scanning container images, attaching a product listing, and automating the publishing of container projects once all criteria are satisfied.

Second part is to illustrate the process of recertifying container projects that already exist in the catalog when a new software release is available. This involves updating the version of the container, including its digest and tag, and republishing it to the catalog.
